Project description: We'll create an NLP algorithm that predicts the sentiments of the user input using the BERT language model. Additionally, we'll use tokenization or classification to predict specific sentiments than the generic positive, negative, and neutral.

Goals: 
1. Understand and develop a rust-bert algorithm
2. Create the algorithm with at least an accuracy rate of 75%

We've chosen to work on this project as we are all interested in NLP and sentiment analysis. Additionally, rust "enables the development of end to end deep-learning pipelines" (retrieved from https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/fey8n6/p_rust_native_language_models_and_nlp_pipelines/).

Technical Overview:

Checkpoint 1: Creating the backend of the project, i.e., the NLP algorithm with BERT language model and achieving an accuracy rate of atleast 40%.
Checkpoint 2: Improving the accuracy of the algorithm. Creating a UI in rust. Exploring libraries to represent the predictions graphically.

Possible Challenges:
1. familiarize ourselves with the different Rust packages and libraries required to implement our algorithm
2.  Create a basic UI in rust
3.  Working with rust-bert module
4.  Understanding the working of the BERT language model.
5.  Finding an accurate dataset

Hello, this is a test.
