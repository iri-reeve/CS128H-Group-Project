 Not good for the money.,   
I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!,  
We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting     minutes just to place our order, another     minutes before the food arrived.,  ,
They also have the best cheese crisp in town.,  
Good value, great food, great service.,  
Couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal.,  
The food is good.,  
It was awesome.,  
I just wanted to leave.,   
We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!,  
I will not be eating there again.,   
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!,   
I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.,   
The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy.,   
Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(,   
An absolute must visit!,  
The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.,  
My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.,   
Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a   star.,   
They really want to make your experience a good one.,  
I will not return.,   
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.,   
Very disappointing!!!,   
The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.,  
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.,   
Pretty awesome place.,  
Ambience is perfect.,  
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.,   
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.,   
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.,   
The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!,  
Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !,  
The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!,  
Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick.,   
High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.,  
Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.,   
We were promptly greeted and seated.,  
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.,   
I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable., ,
After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.,   
This is a good joint.,  
The Macarons here are insanely good.,  
I'm not eating here!,   
Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative.,  
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.,   
This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.,   
Very bad Experience!,   
What a mistake.,   
Food was average at best.,   
Great food.,  
We won't be going back anytime soon!,   
Very Very Disappointed ordered the $   Big Bay Plater.,   
Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.,  
It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.,  
Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.,   
The patio seating was very comfortable.,  
The fried rice was dry as well.,   
Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant!,  
"That just SCREAMS ""LEGIT"" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas.",  
It was just not a fun experience.,  
The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.,  
I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!)., ,
Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!,  
The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.,  
Both great!,  
Eclectic selection.,  
The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.,  
The staff was very attentive.,  
And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).,  
The owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price.,  
Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.,   
dont go here.,   
I promise they won't disappoint.,  
As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.,   
What a great double cheeseburger!,  
Awesome service and food.,  
A fantastic neighborhood gem !!!,  
I can't wait to go back.,  
The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.,   
It's a great place and I highly recommend it.,  
Service was slow and not attentive.,   
I gave it   stars then, and I'm giving it   stars now.,  
Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.,   
Dessert: Panna Cotta was amazing.,  
Very good food, great atmosphere. ,  
Damn good steak.,  
Total brunch fail.,   
Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo., ,
The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant.,  
The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!,  
Good food , good service .,  
It was absolutely amazing.,  
I probably won't be back, to be honest.,   
will definitely be back!,  
The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.,  
Hawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I've tried so far and they're all good.,  
Went for lunch - service was slow.,   
We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.,   
I was mortified.,   
Needless to say, we will never be back here again.,   
Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.,   
The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.,   
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.,   
Have been going since       7 and every meal has been awesome!!,  
Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.,  
The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.,  
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.,   
The atmosphere here is fun.,  
Would not recommend to others.,   
"Service is quick and even ""to go"" orders are just like we like it!",  
I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!,   
That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased.,  
Not my thing.,   
   Thumbs Up!!,  
If you are reading this please don't go there.,   
I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza.,  
Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!,  
They have a really nice atmosphere.,  
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.,   
After one bite, I was hooked.,  
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.,   
Cute, quaint, simple, honest., ,
The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.,  
The food was great as always, compliments to the chef.,  
Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.,  
Awesome selection of beer.,  
Great food and awesome service!,  
One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.,  
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!,   
The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.,  
As for the service, I thought it was good.,  
The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.,   
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.,   
Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.,  
Overall, I like there food and the service.,  
They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.,  
Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it.,   
Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.,   
Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.,  
I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.,  
Never had anything to complain about here.,  
The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.,  
It was way over fried.,   
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.,   
When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.,   
Will not be back!,   
There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.,  
An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.,  
I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from.,  
I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!,   
Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.,  
I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.,  
The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth.,  
Level   spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup.,  
We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!,  
Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid    s and up.,   
When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!,  
I had to wait over     minutes to get my drink and longer to get    arepas.,   
This is a GREAT place to eat!,  
The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.,  
The service was poor and thats being nice.,   
Food was good, service was good, Prices were good.,  
The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!,   
The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.,   
But the service was beyond bad.,   
"I'm so happy to be here!!!""",  
Tasted like dirt.,   
One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .,  
The block was amazing.,  
It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food., 
* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely   Stars!,  
My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.,   
Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.,  
the food is not tasty at all," not to say its ""real traditional Hunan style"".",   
What did bother me, was the slow service.,   
The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!,  
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.,   
These were so good we ordered them twice.,  
So in a nutshell:  ) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.,   
My girlfriend's veal was very bad.,   
Unfortunately, it was not good.,   
I had a pretty satifying experience.,  
Join the club and get awesome offers via email.,  
Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.,  
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.,   
The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.,   
The nachos are a MUST HAVE!,  
We will not be coming back.,   
I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.,  
The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.,  
Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.,  
When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.,  
Once your food arrives it's meh.,   
Paying $7.8  for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.,   
The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.,  
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.,   
So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.,  
The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.,  
This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,  
Mediocre food.,   
Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.,  
I'm super pissd.,   
And service was super friendly.,  
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?,   
This place was such a nice surprise!,  
They were golden-crispy and delicious.,  
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.,   
I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.,  
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.,   
Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.,  
The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.,  
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!,   
The service was terrible though.,   
This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!,   
It was packed!!,   
I love this place.,  
I can say that the desserts were yummy.,  
The food was terrible.,   
The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.,  
It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.,   
This place should honestly be blown up.,   
But I definitely would not eat here again.,   
Do not waste your money here!,   
I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.,  
The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.,  
Awful service.,   
Won't ever go here again.,   
Food quality has been horrible.,   
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.,   
The service here is fair at best.,   
I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.,   
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.,   
Very poor service.,   
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.,   
Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.,  
They were excellent.,  
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.,   
Just had lunch here and had a great experience.,  
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.,   
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.,   
I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!,  
for     bucks a head, i really expect better food.,   
The food came out at a good pace.,  
I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad.,  
I won't be back.,   
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!,   
This place deserves no stars.,   
I would not recommend this place.,   
In fact I'm going to round up to   stars, just because she was so awesome.,  
To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.,   
Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!,  ,
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.,  
I probably would not go here again.,   
So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.,  
The price is reasonable and the service is great.,  
The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.,   
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.,   
Went in for happy hour, great list of wines.,  
Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!,  
I probably won't be coming back here.,   
Worst food/service I've had in a while.,   
This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant.,  
Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.,  
Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.,   
I love their fries and their beans.,  
Always a pleasure dealing with him.,  
They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval.,  
This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.,  
For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go.,  
The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.,  
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.,   
I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.,   
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.,   
All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.,  
My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.,  
Weird vibe from owners.,   
There was hardly any meat.,   
I've had better bagels from the grocery store.,   
Go To Place for Gyros.,  
I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!,  
Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.,   
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.,   
The service was terrible, food was mediocre.,   
We definately enjoyed ourselves.,  
I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.,   
On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.,   
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.,   
The service was extremely slow.,   
After      minutes wait, I got a table.,   
Seriously killer hot chai latte.,  
No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.,   
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.,  
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.,  
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.,   
Worst Thai ever.,   
If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.,  
I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.,  
The pizza selections are good.,  
I had strawberry tea, which was good.,  
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!,   
Overall, a great experience.,  
Spend your money elsewhere.,   
Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!,  
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.,   
And the drinks are WEAK, people!,   
-My order was not correct.,   
Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.,   
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.,   
The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,  
We won't be returning.,   
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.,  
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.,   
Very, very sad.,   
i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?,   
How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!,   
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.,   
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.,   
There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better,   
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.,   
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!,   
What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.,   
Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.,   
This place is disgusting!,   
Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.,  
The RI style calamari was a joke.,   
However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.,   
I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.,   
It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.,   
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.,   
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!,   
Disappointing experience.,   
The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.,   
If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.,   
WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.,   
We won't be going back.,   
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.,   
This place lacked style!!,   
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $   , ridiculous.,   
Don't bother coming here.,   
The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.,   
The building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.,   
It was equally awful.,   
Probably not in a hurry to go back.,   
very slow at seating even with reservation.,   
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.,   
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.,   
The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.,   
It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.,   
I was VERY disappointed!!,   
This place is horrible and way overpriced.,   
Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.,   
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.,   
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.,   
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.,   
Con: spotty service.,   
The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.,   
But then they came back cold.,   
Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.,   
The real disappointment was our waiter.,   
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.,   
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.,   
Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.,   
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?,   
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.,   
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!,   
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.,   
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.,   
But I don't like it.,   
Hell no will I go back,   
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.,   
I don't know what the big deal is about this place," but I won't be back ""ya'all"".",   
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.,   
The ambiance isn't much better.,   
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.,   
The food wasn't good.,   
Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.,  ,
What happened next was pretty....off putting.,   
too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.,   
Overpriced for what you are getting.,   
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.,   
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become    minutes, yet still no food.,   
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.,   
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.,   
Food was below average.,   
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.,   
All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.,   
The problem I have is that they charge $  .99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).,   
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only  /   a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.,   
It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.,   
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.,   
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.,   
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.,   
Spend your money and time some place else.,   
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.,   
the presentation of the food was awful.,   
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.,   
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.,   
Appetite instantly gone.,   
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.,   
The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.,
